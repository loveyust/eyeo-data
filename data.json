But finding ways to articulate and visualize the hidden assumptions present in all data is incredibly challenging. All too often we are (accidentally?) using the power of data to confirm our biases and stereotypes. People will believe false \u2018knowledge\u2019 and spurious relationships when they are beautifully displayed with, at best, a small written caveat that \u201ccorrelation is not causation\u201d.

As a college student in the late eighties, her passion was catapulted by weekly visits to Wax \u2019N Facts, Fantasyland, and later Criminal Records in Atlanta, Georgia. The first time she came to Minneapolis was for EYEO in 2012 and, within an hour of landing, the first place she visited was Electric Fetus.

Why was anyone surprised that as soon as people could bring these mechanical reproductions into their homes, that they would stop going to the theater? After thousands of years of shared story experiences, how did the advent of recording, reproduction, and distribution turn storytelling into a solitary, one-way communication? Often, the inclusion of technology results in a further isolation - for example strapping that mechanical reproduction directly to our faces.  But is it possible that technology could be used to bring interactivity back into storytelling - to get people off the couch, out of the house, out of their comfort zone and once-again participate in shared stories? Mandy and Ivaylo had a crazy idea about how this could work and convinced the Minneapolis Institute of Art to let them make it a real thing.
